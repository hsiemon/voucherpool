# VoucherPool

VoucherPool is a web application developed to attend a developer test with the following requirements:

## Functionalities:

- For a given Special Offer and an expiration date generate for each Recipient a
Voucher Code
- Provide an endpoint, reachable via HTTP, which receives a Voucher Code and Email
and validates the Voucher Code. In Case it is valid, return the Percentage Discount
and set the date of usage
- Extra: For a given Email, return all his valid Voucher Codes with the Name of the
Special Offer

## Tasks:

- Design a database schema
- Write an application
- Add an API endpoint for verifying and redeeming vouchers
- The code should be covered by tests
- Write a documentation with code examples for the implemented calls (Postman
collection is a nice-to-have)
